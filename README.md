# Yaktor Documentation

## Introduction

This repository holds the documentation for the Yaktor tools and framework.

The documentation may currently be slightly out of date because of the move to open source and the introduction of docker.
We are updating the documentation and will try to make sure that the documentation remains accurate.

If you find errors in the documentaiton, please let us know!

## Getting started

There are multiple ways of getting started with Yaktor. 

-**The easy way**: Use Docker
  - InstaLll Docker
  - Pull the yaktor image from the Docker Hub
- **The hard way**: Install the tool piece-by-piece which requires separate installations of:
  - Node.js
  - MongoDB
  - Java
  - Ruby
  - ActiveMQ
  - AsciiDoctor
  - Graphviz
  - Cassandra 

For now, we'll focus on the easy way. Follow [these steps](DockerInstall.md) to get started.
