# Yaktor Documentation

## Introduction

This is the documentation for the Yaktor tools and framework.

The documentation may currently be slightly out of date because of the move to open source and the introduction of docker.
We are updating the documentation and will try to make sure that the documentation remains accurate.

If you find errors in the documentation, please let us know!

## Getting started

There are multiple ways of getting started with Yaktor.

- **The easy way**: Use Docker
  - InstaLll Docker
  - Pull the yaktor image from the Docker Hub
- **The hard way**: Install the dependencies one-by-one, which requires separate installations of:
  - Node.js
  - MongoDB
  - Java
  - Ruby
  - ActiveMQ
  - AsciiDoctor
  - Graphviz
  - Cassandra

For now, we'll focus on the easy way. Follow [these steps](DockerInstall.md) to get started.

## Documentation site

In addition to this repository, we have a website where we generate documentation from this repository.

The documentation site can be found at http://yaktor.io
