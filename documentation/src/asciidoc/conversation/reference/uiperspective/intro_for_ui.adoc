= Conversation Engine for U/I Developers

== Introduction

This document contains a discussion of what we believe is the most important things for U/I developers to understand when working with the Yaktor engine.

The Yaktor engine from a U/I perspective is primarily exposed through something we call the +conversation language+.

== What is the Conversation Language (+cl+)

From a U/I perspective, the conversation language is a way to define an interface between the browser and the server.
The conversation language can also be used to define the behavior of the server side code, but we'll focus primarily on how to use the conversation language from a U/I perspective.

The interface between the browser and the server is primarily taking two shapes:

* REST API's (aka REpresentational State Transfer)
* Websocket based user-agent API's.

=== What is a REST API?

REST is a way to create, read, update or delete information on a server using simple HTTP calls. It is an alternative to more complex mechanisms like SOAP, CORBA en RPC. A REST call is simply a GET HTTP request to the server.

You can read more about REST here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer

=== What is WebSocket based user-agent API's?

Perhaps we should define what WebSockets and user-agents are first?

* WebSocket is a protocol providing full-duplex communications channels over a single TCP connection. 
* User-agent is software (a software agent) that is acting on behalf of a user.

The conversation allows us to define what we call +agents+. For each agent we can generate a JavaScript implementation that you can use from the browser to participate in what we call +conversations+.

That gives us two more words we need to define.

* +Conversation+. A conversation is a definition of a set of behaviors that the application need to exhibit. The way the conversation specifies this behavior by defining a set of +agents+ and the collaboration between this set of +agents+.
* +Agent+. An agent defines some piece of behavior in the conversation

== A Simple REST-full Example

Let's start with a simple example of a REST API.

Let's say we want to make a simple user interface to keep track of a TODO list.
This would be a typical example of when REST API would be the most proper way to connect between the browser and server.

What we as U/I developers is to get access to the TODO list. 
The way to think of this is that we're accing a +resource+ of type TODO items.

We would probably have to be able to:

* Get a list of the TODO items
* Get the details of each TODO item
* Create new TODO items
* Delete existing TODO items
* Update existing TODO items
* Search for specific TODO items

When using REST, we want to think of the server as a simple data provider.

We would define this in a simple text file with the extension +cl+ (conversation langauge).

There are two things we'll have to define:

1. What makes up a TODO item?
2. What are the functions we need (for example we may only need to read a resource, not delete)?

Here is an example of a CL file that defines such a resource:

[source]
--------------------------
conversation ToDoConversation { <1>
	/*
	 * This defines the data structure we'll use
	 */
	type TODOItem {	// <2>
		String name
		String details?
		Date whenDue?
	}
	/*
	 * Defines a resource API
	 */
	resource // <3>
		/todos  // <4>
		for ToDoConversation.TODOItem  <5>
		offers (create read update delete find)  <6>
		interchanges (json) <7>
}
--------------------------
<1> The name of the conversation is +ToDoConversation+.
<2> The data structure for todo items is called TODOItem (we need to name it so that we can refer to it later).
<3> The keyword +resource+ starts the definition of a REST API.
<4> After the keyword +resource+ we define the URL that makes up the base for the REST API (+/todos+ in this example).
<5> Next we specify the the data structure that we'll be interchanging. We'll come back to what this looks like for us later.
<6> Next we specify what functions we'll require to access the resource.
<7> And finally, we define that we expect to send/receive JSON data (as opposed to say XML).

=== What is a Type?

In the +cl+ file, we defined something we call type.
If your only programming experience is JavaScript, the concept of type (aka class) may be unfamiliar.

A type defines the rules for a data structure. 
On the U/I side, most of our data structures are represented by JSON. 
Let's study the example of the +TODOItem+ from the +cl+ file.

[source]
--------------------------
	type TODOItem {	// <1>
		String name 	// <2>
		String details? // <3>
		Date whenDue?   // <4>
	}
--------------------------
<1> We're defining rules for a kind of object (+type+) that we'll call +TODOItem+.
<2> TODOItems should always have a property +name+ and it must be a string.
<3> TODOItems may have a property called +details+ and if it does, it must be a string.
	We see that it is optional because the specifier has added a questionmark at the end of the property definition.
<4> TODOItems may have a property called +whenDue+ and if it does, it must be a data type.
	A date type is actually also a string in JSON terms, but it has to follow the rules of ISO8601.

Let's take a look at some JSON objects and see if they confirm to the rules of +TODOItem+.

[source,javascript]
--------------------------
var someObject = {
	"name": "Pickup John at Airport",
	"details": "John arrives at 8PM. His flight is AA821 and he'll call me when he lands."
};
--------------------------

This object confirms to the rules of TODOItems (we can say, it is a valid instance of a TODOItem).
The object has two properties; +name+, which was required and is of type string; +details+ which is not required, but when present must be a string.
Notice that we don't have the property +whenDue+, but this is perfectly OK as the specifier of the TODOItem made +whenDue+ optional.

[source,javascript]
--------------------------
var someObject = {
	"name": 55,
	"details": "John arrives at 8PM. His flight is AA821 and he'll call me when he lands."
};
--------------------------
In the above example, the +someObject+ does not confirm to the +TODOItem+ rules as the name was specified to be a string, but we provided a numeric value instead.

[source,javascript]
--------------------------
var someObject = {
	"name": "Pickup John at Airport",
	"details": "John arrives at 8PM. His flight is AA821 and he'll call me when he lands.",
	"whenDue": "tomorrow"
};
--------------------------
+someObject+ is not a valid +TODOItem+ as the +whenDue+ property can not be parsed into a Date format using the ISO8601 specification.

=== Why Types?

We typically define types because we want to ensure that the communication between the browser and the server is well understood by the ones writing the U/I and the server.

You can think of the conversation language as a definition of a contract between the U/I developers and the backend developers (it does much more than that, but for now, this is a good way to think about it).
We want to make sure that when the server sends us some data that we know exactly what data to expect. 
A server programmer has exactly the same need when they receive data from us.

=== Accessing the REST Resource

TODO:
	Add some examples of how to access the REST API here (perhaps also show some easy IDE RestEasy?)

=== U/I Generator

We have also provided a simple U/I generator that generates the code to access the REST API.
This U/I generator is out of scope for this article, but it may help you get a good starting point for your development.

To read more about the U/I Generator see this article (TODO INSERT LINK HERE).

== Interacting with a Conversation

You most likely already had experience working with REST APIs. 
The next topic, how to interact with conversations, will expose you to a technique that is less common and may at first look a bit scary.

We mentioned earlier that we sometimes specify the interaction between the browsers and server to use WebSockets over a user-agent API.

With this type of interaction, partial behavior is of the U/I is dictated by the server. 
The conversation language generates some JavaScript that interact with the server in a way where:
